# Vibe planning

* How could consulting on a local plan be different in the age of AI?
* Could we have a consulation which is about offering solutions to meeting the housing need?
* Could the consultation process allow people to upvote, or build on other people's ideas?

Can we enable "vibe planning"?

# Roadmap

* <s>build grid for an LPAs</s>
* <s>add area of green-belt in each cell</s>

* find target housing numbers
* connectivity of each cell to an existing school
